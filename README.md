# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Project
This is a supply chain optimization project, accomplished through calculating the optimal value of workflow and total mileage covered between dozens of regional distribution centers and thousands of retail stores with latitudes and longitudes using statistical computations in R with sample data. Then build optimization models in Excel and Python to compute total cost for validation purpose, and retrieved full datasets from MySQL database to minimize actual total cost under various constraints using Gurobi Solver in Python.
